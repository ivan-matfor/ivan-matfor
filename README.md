## 💡 About Me

I’m deeply passionate about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and the power of turning raw data into something meaningful. My motivation comes from a genuine curiosity about how things work—and a desire to make them work better.

I strongly believe that **building hands-on projects** is the best way to grow and to give back to the community. Whether it’s a small experiment or a larger analytical tool, I use every project as a learning experience and a way to help others through open sharing.

💬 I probably don't pay OpenAI enough for my usage... and that says a lot.
