## 💡 About Me

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence along with data transformation into meaningful insights drive my deep passion. My motivation stems from both my desire to understand how things function and my goal to enhance their operation.

The most effective way to develop skills and serve the community involves hands-on project development. I treat every project as a learning opportunity to help others through open sharing whether it is a small experiment or a larger analytical tool.

💬 I probably don't pay OpenAI enough for my usage... and that says a lot.
